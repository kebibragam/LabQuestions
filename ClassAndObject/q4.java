//Create a class Point with member method distanceTo(Point p2) which returns the distance betweencurrent object and method parameter p2 and another member method getMidPoint(Point p1,Point p2)which returns Point object containing mid point between p1 and p2. Also include x and y as membervariables.   Create   two   instances   P1   and   P2   and   show   distance   between   them   calling   the   methoddistanceTo(). Similarly create third instance P3 which represents the mid_point between them
